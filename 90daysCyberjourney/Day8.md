# 📘 Day 8 of 90 – Laying the Foundation with OWASP Top 10

Today marks a pivotal shift in my 90-day journey into cybersecurity — diving deep into the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Understanding these is essential for any ethical hacker or web security expert.

## 🔐 What I Explored:
- A01:2021 – Broken Access Control  
- A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures  
- A03:2021 – Injection  
- A04:2021 – Insecure Design  
- A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration  

## 🎯 Key Takeaways:
- These vulnerabilities are responsible for the majority of security breaches today.
- Real-world examples helped me see how attackers exploit them.
- I took notes and created a mental map to relate each vuln to attack surfaces.

## 🛠️ Setup:
- ✅ Registered on [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
- ✅ Explored interactive labs and learning paths
- ✅ Planning hands-on practice for the coming days

## 🧠 Learning Focus:
> "The best way to predict the future is to learn from the past."

This is just the start — excited for more practicals ahead!
