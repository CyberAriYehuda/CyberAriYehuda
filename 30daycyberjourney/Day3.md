# 🛡️ 30 Days of Cybersecurity Journey - Day 3

# 🧪 Project: OWASP Juice Shop (Web VAPT Simulation)

Today I explored the infamous OWASP Juice Shop — a deliberately vulnerable web application used to practice web-based attacks in a safe environment.

# 🔍 Vulnerabilities Discovered:
1. 🛑 Login Bypass with `admin@juice-sh.op : admin123`
2. 🕵️ Access to Admin Panel
3. 💬 Exposed Chatbot Widget (for social engineering practice)
4. 🪪 JWT Token Manipulation
5. 🔍 SQL Injection in Login/Search Bar
6. 🔑 Sensitive Data Exposure via Developer Tools

# ⚙️ Tools Used:
- Browser DevTools
- Burp Suite (basic passive recon)
- JWT.io
- OWASP Juice Shop

  NOTE:- TO test the website download it from linux (command:- npm install juice-shop) 



### 💡 Lessons Learned:
- How real-world insecure coding leads to data breaches
- Importance of session management and token security
- The role of recon and enumeration even in web apps
