🧠 Day 15 of my hashtag#Cybersecurity30DaysJourney

Today’s labs focused on a classic but deadly flaw — Unrestricted File Uploads.

✅ Completed:
- Unrestricted file upload lab 
- File upload protection bypass lab

What I learned:
- It’s not about uploading — it’s about what the server allows without asking questions.
- A `.php.jpg` or a spoofed MIME can be all it takes to trigger RCE.

🛡️ From a Blue Team perspective: 
A SOC should detect anomalies like `.php` uploads or suspicious multipart POSTs.

“Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.” – Ephesians 6:11
