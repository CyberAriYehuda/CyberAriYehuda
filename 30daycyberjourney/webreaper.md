WebReaper - Reconnaissance Automation Tool
WebReaper is a Python-based tool that automates reconnaissance tasks for cybersecurity assessments. It performs DNS lookups, WHOIS queries, subdomain/email harvesting, and banner grabbing on a target domain.
Features

DNS Lookup: Enumerates DNS records using dnsrecon.
WHOIS Lookup: Retrieves domain registration details using the system whois command.
Subdomain & Email Harvesting: Discovers subdomains and emails with theHarvester.
Banner Grabbing: Fetches HTTP headers using curl.
Automatically installs dependencies on Linux (supports apt and yum).
Saves results in timestamped folders for easy analysis.
Robust error handling and user-friendly output.

Requirements

Linux system with Python 3.
Administrative privileges (sudo) for installing dependencies.
Internet connection for tool installation and scans.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/CyberAriYehuda/CyberAriYehuda.git


Navigate to the webreaper folder:cd webreaper


Make the script executable:chmod +x webreaper.py



Usage
Run the script with a target domain:
./webreaper.py -d example.com

Results are saved in webreaper_results/<domain>_<timestamp>/ with files:

dnsrecon.txt
whois.txt
theharvester.txt
banner.txt

Example
./webreaper.py -d google.com
