# 🚀 Day 9 & 10 of Cybersecurity 90 Days Challenge

## 🗓️ Focus: OWASP Top 10 Labs (PortSwigger Apprentice Level)

This week’s deep dive involved solving **4 labs** targeting two major web security categories:

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Information Disclosure

- ✅ **Lab 1**: Information disclosure in error messages  
- ✅ **Lab 2**: Information disclosure on debug page

**🧠 What I learned:**
- How error messages can unintentionally leak stack traces and internal logic
- The risk of deploying debug pages in production environments

---

## 🔐 Access Control Vulnerabilities

- ✅ **Lab 3**: Unprotected admin functionality  
- ✅ **Lab 4**: Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL

**🧠 What I learned:**
- Importance of authentication/authorization mechanisms
- How attackers can access admin panels through weak or absent access controls

---

## 🌱 Takeaway:
These beginner-level labs provided practical insight into the dangers of poor coding decisions and the need for layered security. Each challenge strengthened my understanding of **security-by-design** principles.
