# 🧠 Day 12 & 13 – Cybersecurity 30-Day Journey

This week, I explored two very different but essential worlds of cybersecurity:

- 🔍 **Application Logic Flaws (OWASP A04 – Insecure Design)**
- 📊 **SIEM & Log Analysis with Splunk**

---

## 🔍 Day 12 – Business Logic Vulnerability (OWASP A04)

Completed the [PortSwigger Lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/lab-logic-flaw-in-business-logic) on bonus point abuse.  
This wasn’t about XSS or SQLi — it was about **exploiting flawed design thinking** in the app’s logic.

### 💡 Key Takeaway:
> You don’t need broken code to break an application — **weak logic is enough.**

## 📊 Day 13 – Splunk Fundamentals 1 Certified ✅

Proud to share that I’ve officially completed the **Splunk Fundamentals 1** course by Splunk Education.

### 🌐 Now confident in:
- Log search & filtering  
- Basic SPL (Search Processing Language)  
- Creating dashboards, alerts, and real-time monitoring  

This is a **major step** in building my **SOC + Blue Team foundation**.

Every lab, every log — one step closer to **real-world readiness**.
