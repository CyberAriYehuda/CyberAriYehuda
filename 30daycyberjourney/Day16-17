üß† Day 16 & 17 of my hashtag#Cybersecurity30DaysJourney

This week, I explored something futuristic and powerful ‚Äî how AI + Python can intersect with cybersecurity.

I‚Äôve officially completed the Build RAG Chatbot with Python course from LetsUpgrade! 
Course covered:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture 
- LangChain + OpenAI integration 
- PDF ingestion + chatbot response systems 
- Deployment with Gradio for UI testing

How does this connect to security?

 Cyber defense is becoming smarter. AI-powered playbooks and auto-triage bots are the future of SOC automation** and incident response.

This project taught me:
- How to merge Python + LLMs + custom data
- How chatbots can be used in security (e.g., auto SOC queries, phishing triage)
