Day 1 of 30 â€” Entering the Cyber Arena

Date: April 12, 2025  
Theme:From Trainer to Digital Warrior

After 6 months of training students in Ethical Hacking, CCNA, OWASP Top 10, and Forensics,  
I now walk the path myself â€” stepping into the shadows, sharpening my blade, and solving real-world labs in the field of VAPT.

This isnâ€™t just a journey. Itâ€™s a *forging of skill and mindset* â€” from mentor to practitioner.

ðŸ”¥ Goals for the Next 30 Days:
- Solve hands-on cybersecurity labs & challenges  
- Share war logs through blogs and GitHub  
- Earn certs that back the battle scars  
- Hunt down high-impact internships & freelance ops  
- Grow into the pentester I once only trained others to become

Letâ€™s go. The sword is drawn â€” now comes the grind.
