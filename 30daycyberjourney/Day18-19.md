🧠 Day 18 & 19 of my hashtag#Cybersecurity30DaysJourney

Excited to share that I’ve completed the Power BI Bootcamp by LetsUpgrade — expanding my skills beyond just detection and response.

📊 Why Power BI as a cybersecurity learner?

In today’s SOCs, data visibility is everything. Whether it's threat intel, log aggregation, or incident metrics — analysts need to visualize security trends, alert frequency, and attack surfaces in real time.

What I learned:
- Creating dashboards with real-time data 
- Connecting and querying sources like CSV, Excel, and APIs 
- Building visual reports to identify anomalies faster 

🚨 From SIEM to SOC dashboards, Power BI can complement tools like Splunk by allowing us to present findings to management or clients — cleanly, visually, effectively.
